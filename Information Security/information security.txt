Computer Security: Measures and controls that ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information system assets including hardware, software, firmware, and information being processed, stored, and communicated.

• Confidentiality: This term covers two related concepts:
— Data confidentiality: Assures that private or confidential information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals.
— Privacy: Assures that individuals control or influence what information related to them may be collected and stored and by whom and to whom that information may be disclosed.

• Integrity: This term covers two related concepts:
— Data integrity: Assures that information and programs are changed only in a specified and authorized manner.
— System integrity: Assures that a system performs its intended function in an unimpaired manner, free from deliberate or inadvertent unauthorized manipulation of the system.
• Availability: Assures that systems work promptly and service is not denied to authorized users.

• Confidentiality: Preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information. A loss of confidentiality is the unauthorized disclosure of information.

• Integrity: Guarding against improper information modification or destruction, including ensuring information nonrepudiation and authenticity. A loss of integrity is the unauthorized modification or destruction of information.

• Availability: Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information. A loss of availability is the disruption of access to or use of information or an information system.

types of cybersecurity 
1. Infrastructure Security
2. Network Security
3. Information security (InfoSec)
4. Cloud Security
5. Organizational Policy Framework
6. End-User Behavior


An attack is a threat that is carried out (threat action) and, if successful, leads to an undesirable violation of security, or threat consequence.two types of attacks:
--> Active attack:An attempt to alter system resources or affect their operation.
--> Passive attack:An attempt to learn or make use of information from the system that does not affect system resources.

Threat: Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of service.

Symmetric encryption, also referred to as conventional encryption or single-key encryption, A symmetric encryption scheme has five ingredients

• Plaintext: This is the original message or data that is fed into the algorithm as input.
• Encryption algorithm: The encryption algorithm performs various substitutions and transformations on the plaintext.
• Secret key: The secret key is also input to the encryption algorithm. The exact substitutions and transformations performed by the algorithm depend on the key.
• Ciphertext: This is the scrambled message produced as output. It depends on the plaintext and the secret key. For a given message, two different keys will produce two different ciphertexts.
• Decryption algorithm: This is essentially the encryption algorithm run in reverse. It takes the ciphertext and the secret key and produces the original plaintext.


There are two requirements for secure use of symmetric encryption:

1. We need a strong encryption algorithm.
2. The sender and receiver must have obtained copies of the secret key in a secure fashion and must keep the key secure.

There are two general approaches to attacking a symmetric encryption scheme.
1. Cryptanalytic attacks rely on the nature of the algorithm plus perhaps some knowledge of the general characteristics of the plaintext, or even some sample plaintext-ciphertext pairs.
2. brute-force attack, is to try every possible key on a piece of ciphertext until an intelligible translation into plaintext is obtained.

A stream cipher processes the input elements continuously, producing output one element at a time, as it goes along.

public-key cryptography is asymmetric,


Drawbacks of DES algorithm 
1. A secondary drawback is that both DES and 3DES use a 64-bit block size. For reasons of both efficiency and security, a larger block size is desirable. 
2. 3DES, requires 3 times more calculation than DES, is correspondingly slower.
